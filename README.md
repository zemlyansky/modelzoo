# modelzoo.js

The repo is based on [gpt-tfjs](https://github.com/zemlyansky/gpt-tfjs) and its TypeScript [fork](https://github.com/lukemovement/gpt-tfjs/tree/typescript-refactor) by [lukemovement](https://github.com/lukemovement). A lot of models share common layers and preprocessing methods so it makes sense to continue the work in a single repo rather than copy-pasting the same transformer architecture over and over again or having to maintain multiple repos for each layer. Currently not a lot to see here.
